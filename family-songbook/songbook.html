      <p> There's a little white duck sitting in the water <br>
      a little white duck doing what he oughter <br>
      he took a bite of a lily pad <br>
      flapped his wings and he said "I'm glad <br>
      I'm a little white duck sitting in the water <br>
      quack! quack! quack!" </p>
      <p> There's a little green frog swimming in the water <br>

      ribbit! ribbit! ribbit!" </p>

      a little black bug doing what he oughter<br>
      he tickled the frog on the lily pad<br>
      that the little duck bit and he said "I'm glad<br>

      he ate the bug and he said "I'm glad<br>
      I'm a little red snake playing in the water<br>
      hiss! hiss! hiss!" </p>

      <p> Now there's nobody left sitting in the water<br>
      nobody left doing what he oughter<br>
      there's nothing left but the lily pad<br>
      the duck and the frog ran away, I'm sad<br>
      'cause there's nobody left sitting in the water<br>
      boo! hoo! hoo! </p>

      When he starts throbbin’ his old sweet song <br>
      Wake up, wake up, you sleepyhead, Get up, get up, get out of bed <br>

    <h2 id="little-green-valley"> Little Green Valley </h2>
      <p> I see a candlelight down in the little green valley <br>
        Where morning glory vines are twining ‘round the door <br>
        Oh, how I wish I were there tonight<br>
        Down in the little green valley<br>
        That’s where my homesick heart will trouble me no more.<br>
        There’s only one thing ever gives me consolation.<br>
        And that’s the dream that I’ll be going back someday.<br>
        Now every night down upon my knees<br>
        I pray the Lord to please take me<br>
        Back to that little old green valley far away<br>
      </p>
      <p>I hear a mockingbird down in the little green valley<br>
        He&rsquo;s singing out a song of welcome just for me<br>
        And someone waits by the garden gate<br>
        Down in the little green valley<br>
        When I get back again, how happy she will be.<br>
        And by a little babbling brook, once more we&rsquo;ll wander<br>
        And in a shady nook, we&rsquo;ll dream the hours away<br>
        And I will leave all my cares behind<br>
        Go where I know I&rsquo;ll find sunshine<br>
        Back to that little old green valley far away.<br>
      </p>

      <h2 id="johnny-verbeck"> Johnny Verbeck </h2>
      <p>Oh, once there was a Dutchman, his name was Johnny Verbeck,<br>
      He used to deal in sausages and sauerkraut and speck.<br>
      He made the finest sausages that I had ever seen<br>
      Until one day he invented that machine.</p>
      <i><p> Chorus</i>:<br>
      Oh, Mister, mister Johhny Verbeck, how could you be so mean,<br>
      I told you you&rsquo;d be sorry for inventing that machine.<br>
      Now all the neighbors cats and dogs will never more be seen<br>
      They&rsquo;ll all be ground to sausages in Johnny Verbeck&rsquo;s machine.</p>
      <p> One day the thing got busted, the darn thing wouldn&rsquo;t go<br>
      So Johnny Verbeck he crawled inside to see what made it so<br>
      His wife was having a nightmare and walking in her sleep<br>
      She gave the crank a heck of a yank and Johnny Verbeck was meat.</p>
      <i><p> Repeat Chorus</p></i>
      <p>
      One day a little fat boy came walking in the store<br>
      He bought a pound of sausages and laid them on the floor<br>
      Then he began to whistle he whistled up a tune<br>
      And all the little sausages went dancing round the room</p>

          Means we&rsquo;re happy in my blue heaven.</p>
          <p> We&rsquo;ll see a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy room<br>
          A little nest that&rsquo;s nestled where the roses bloom</p>

        <p>There&rsquo;s a long, long trail a-winding,<br>
          Into the land of my dreams.<br>
          Where the nightingale are singing,<br>
          And the white moon beams.<br>
          There&rsquo;s a long, long time of waiting,<br>
          Until my dreams all come true,<br>
          Till the day when I&rsquo;ll be going,<br>
          Down that long long trail with you. <br>

      <h2 id="mariah"> Mariah <em> dedicated to Mariah Jane Hart </em> </h2>
      <p>Oh, way out west they got a name<br>
      For rain and wind and fire<br>
      The rain is Tess, the fire is Joe<br>
      And they call the wind Mariah</p>

      <p>Mariah blows the stars around<br>
      And sets the clouds a-flying<br>
      Mariah makes the mountains sound <br>
      Like folks up there were dying.</p>

      <p><i>Chorus</i>:<br>
      Mariah, Mariah<br>
      They call the wind Mariah</p>

      <p>Before I knew Mariah&rsquo;s name<br>
      And hear he wailing whining<br>
      I had a girl and she had me<br>
      And the sun was always shining</p>
      <p>
      But then one day I left my girl<br>
      I left her far behind me<br>
      And now I&rsquo;m lost, so good and lost<br>
      Not even God can find me</p>

      <p><i> Repeat Chorus</i><br>

      <p>Out here they got a name for rain<br>
      For wind and fire only<br>
      But when you&rsquo;re lost and all alone<br>
      There ain&rsquo;t no word but lonely</p>

      <p>And I&rsquo;m a lost and lonely man<br>
      Without a star to guide me<br>
      Mariah blow my love to me<br>
      I need my girl beside me</p>

      <p><i> Repeat Chorus</i><br>

      <p>Mariah, Mariah,<br>
      Blow my love to me</p>
    <h2 id = homeward-bound> Homeward Bound </h2>
    <p>In the quiet misty morning when the moon has gone to bed, <br>
    when the sparrows stop their winging and the sky is clear and red.<br>
    When the summer&rsquo;s ceased its gleaming, <br>
    When the corn is past its prime, <br>
    When adventure&rsquo;s lost its meaning, <br>
    I&rsquo;ll be homeward bound in time.</p>

    <p><i>Chorus</i>:<br>
    Bind me not to the pasture: chain me not to the plow.<br>
    Set me free to find my calling and I&rsquo;ll return to you somehow.</p>

    <p>If you find it&rsquo;s me you&rsquo;re missing, if you&rsquo;re hoping I&rsquo;ll return. <br>
    To your thoughts I&rsquo;ll soon be list&rsquo;ning in the road I&rsquo;ll stop and turn.<br>
    Then the wind will set me racing <br>
    As my journey nears its end,<br>
    And the path I&rsquo;ll be retracing <br>
    When I&rsquo;m homeward bound again.</p>

    <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>

    <p>In the quiet misty morning when the moon has gone to bed,<br>
    When the sparrows stop their singing, <br>
    I&rsquo;ll be homeward bound again.</p>

    <p>Morning has broken like the first morning,<br>
    Blackbird has spoken like the first bird.<br>
    Praise for the singing, praise for the morning,<br>
    Praise for them springing fresh from the world.</p>

    <p>Sweet the rain&rsquo;s new fall, sunlit from heaven,<br>
    Like the first dewfall on the first grass.<br>
    Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden,<br>
    Sprung in completeness where his feet pass.</p>

    <p>Mine is the sunlight, Mine is the morning,<br>
    Born of the one light Eden saw play.<br>

    God&rsquo;s recreation of the new day.<br>

    <p>Try to remember that kind of September<br>
    When grass was green and grain was yellow<br>
    Try to remember that kind of September<br>
    When life was slow and oh so mellow<br>
    Try to remember that kind of September<br>
    When you were a tender and callow fellow<br>
    Try to remember and if you remember<br>
    Then follow <em> follow, follow ,follow </em> </p>

    <p>Try to remember when life was so tender<br>
    That no one wept except the willow<br>
    Try to remember when life was so tender<br>
    That dreams were kept beside your pillow<br>
    Try to remember when life was so tender<br>
    That love was an ember about to billow<br>
    Try to remember and if you remember<br>
    Then follow <em> follow, follow ,follow </em><br>

    Deep in December it&rsquo;s nice to remember<br>
    Although you know the snow will follow<br>
    Deep in December it&rsquo;s nice to remember<br>
    Without a hurt the heart is hollow<br>
    Deep in December it&rsquo;s nice to remember<br>
    The fire of September that made us mellow<br>
    Try to remember and if you remember<br>
    Then follow . . .follow your heart<br>
