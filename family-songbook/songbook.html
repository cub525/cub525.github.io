    Giddy-up, we’re homeward bound </p>
  <p> I like to take a horse and buggy <br>

  <h2 id="little-white-duck"> Little White Duck </h2>
  <p> There's a little white duck sitting in the water, <br>
    a little white duck doing what he oughter, <br>
    he took a bite of a lily pad, <br>
    flapped his wings and he said "I'm glad <br>
    I'm a little white duck sitting in the water. <br>
    Quack! quack! quack!" </p>
  <p> There's a little green frog swimming in the water, <br>
    a little green frog doing what he oughter, <br>
    he jumped right off of the lily pad,<br>
    that the little duck bit and he said "I'm glad<br>
    I'm a little green frog swimming in the water.<br>
    ribbit! ribbit! ribbit!" </p>

  <p> There's a little black bug floating on the water,<br>
    a little black bug doing what he oughter,<br>
    he tickled the frog on the lily pad,<br>
    that the little duck bit and he said "I'm glad<br>
    I'm a little black bug floating on the water.<br>
    bzzz! bzzz! bzzz!" </p>

  <p> There's a little red snake playing in the water,<br>

    he ate the bug and he said "I'm glad<br>
    I'm a little red snake playing in the water.<br>
    hiss! hiss! hiss!" </p>

  <p> Now there's nobody left sitting in the water,<br>
    nobody left doing what he oughter,<br>
    there's nothing left but the lily pad,<br>
    the duck and the frog ran away, I'm sad<br>
    'cause there's nobody left sitting in the water.<br>
    Boo! hoo! hoo! </p>

    Or the hunter will shoot me dead.<br>
    Come little rabbit, come with me.<br>
    Happy we will be. </p>

  <h2 id="little-green-valley"> Little Green Valley </h2>
  <p> I see a candlelight down in the little green valley, <br>
    Where morning glory vines are twining ‘round the door. <br>
    Oh, how I wish I were there tonight,<br>
    Down in the little green valley.<br>
    That’s where my homesick heart will trouble me no more.<br>
    There’s only one thing ever gives me consolation.<br>
    And that’s the dream that I’ll be going back someday.<br>
    Now every night down upon my knees.<br>
    I pray the Lord to please take me,<br>
    Back to that little old green valley far away.<br>
  </p>
  <p>I hear a mockingbird down in the little green valley,<br>
    He&rsquo;s singing out a song of welcome just for me.<br>
    And someone waits by the garden gate,<br>
    Down in the little green valley.<br>
    When I get back again, how happy she will be.<br>
    And by a little babbling brook, once more we&rsquo;ll wander,<br>
    And in a shady nook, we&rsquo;ll dream the hours away,<br>
    And I will leave all my cares behind,<br>
    Go where I know I&rsquo;ll find sunshine,<br>
    Back to that little old green valley far away.<br>

  <h2 id=homeward-bound> Homeward Bound </h2>
  <p>In the quiet misty morning when the moon has gone to bed, <br>
    when the sparrows stop their winging and the sky is clear and red.<br>
    When the summer&rsquo;s ceased its gleaming, <br>
    When the corn is past its prime, <br>
    When adventure&rsquo;s lost its meaning, <br>
    I&rsquo;ll be homeward bound in time.</p>

  <p><i>Chorus</i>:<br>
    Bind me not to the pasture; chain me not to the plow.<br>
    Set me free to find my calling and I&rsquo;ll return to you somehow.</p>

  <p>If you find it&rsquo;s me you&rsquo;re missing, if you&rsquo;re hoping I&rsquo;ll return. <br>
    To your thoughts I&rsquo;ll soon be list&rsquo;ning in the road I&rsquo;ll stop and turn.<br>
    Then the wind will set me racing <br>
    As my journey nears its end,<br>
    And the path I&rsquo;ll be retracing <br>
    When I&rsquo;m homeward bound again.</p>

  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>

  <p>In the quiet misty morning when the moon has gone to bed,<br>

    Praise for them springing fresh from the world.</p>

  <p>Sweet the rain&rsquo;s new fall, sunlit from heaven,<br>
    Like the first dewfall on the first grass.<br>
    Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden,<br>
    Sprung in completeness where his feet pass.</p>

  <p>Mine is the sunlight, Mine is the morning,<br>
    Born of the one light Eden saw play.<br>

    When grass was green and grain was yellow<br>
    Try to remember that kind of September<br>
    When life was slow and oh so mellow<br>
    Try to remember that kind of September<br>
    When you were a tender and callow fellow<br>
    Try to remember and if you remember<br>
    Then follow <em> follow, follow ,follow </em> </p>

  <p>Try to remember when life was so tender<br>
    That no one wept except the willow<br>
    Try to remember when life was so tender<br>
    That dreams were kept beside your pillow<br>
    Try to remember when life was so tender<br>
    That love was an ember about to billow<br>

    Deep in December it&rsquo;s nice to remember<br>
    The fire of September that made us mellow<br>

    And gave them quite a few</p>

  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>

  <p>First we got the Topie cat<br>
    And then the Brownie cow<br>
    Two bantam hens and Raider dog<br>
    But we don&rsquo;t have them now</p>

  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>

  <p>You ask me where I&rsquo;m going, so early in the morn&rsquo;.<br>
    I&rsquo;m just a traveler roamin&rsquo;, just a-roamin&rsquo; on.<br>

    Many times I&rsquo;ve searched in vain<br>
    For a spot that seems like heaven to me<br>
    And I long to see again</p>
  <p> <i>Chorus</i>:<br>
    Oh, I&rsquo;m going to hide away, far out on that Utah trail<br>
    Moonlight&rsquo;s as bright was day, far out on that Utah Trail.<br>
    That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll settle down, in a peace where all is still<br>
    In a little hut just built for two tucked away in the heart of the hills<br>
    And, there &lsquo;neath the skies are blue in the golden summertime<br>
    That&rsquo;s where all friends are true and all nature is in rhyme<br>
    Someone is waiting with a love that never fails<br>
    Waiting patiently to welcome me far out on that Utah trail</p>
  <p> The golden leaves of autumn,<br>
    The verdant greens of spring.<br>
    Will linger on forever<br>
    Will fondest mem&rsquo;ries bring.<br>

    Through the woods and swimming holes<br>
    And at evening time the setting sun <br>
    Turned the hills from green to gold</p>

  <h2 id="puff-the-magic-dragon"> Puff the Magic Dragon </h2>
  <p>Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea<br>
    And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honalee<br>
    Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff<br>
    And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff</p>

  <p><i>Chorus</i>:<br> Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea<br>
    And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honalee<br>
    Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea<br>
    And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honalee</p>

  <p>Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail<br>
    Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail<br>
    Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came<br>
    Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name</p>

  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>

  <p>A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys<br>
    Painted wings and giant's rings make way for other toys<br>
    One gray night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more<br>
    And Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearful roar</p>

  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>

  <p> His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain<br>
    Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane<br>
    Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave<br>
    So Puff, that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave<br>

    For courtin&rsquo;s a pleasure, but parting is grief;<br>
    A false-hearted lover is worse than a thief.<br>
    A thief he will rob all, the money you save,<br>
    But a false-hearted lover, puts you in the grave.</p>
  <h2 id="on-top-of-spaghetti"> On Top of Spaghetti <i> Parody of On Top of Old Smoky</i> </h2>
  <p>On top of spaghetti, all covered with cheese,<br>
    I lost my poor meatball, when somebody sneezed.<br>
    It rolled off the table and onto the floor,<br>
    And then my poor meatball, it rolled out the door.<br>
    It rolled down the sidewalk, and under a bush,<br>
    And then my poor meatball was nothing but mush.</p>
  <h2 id="mormon-sunday-school-song"> Mormon Sunday School Song</h2>
  <p><i>Chorus</i>:<br>
    Young folks, old folks, everybody come<br>
    Join the Mormon Sunday School and have a lot of fun<br>
    Check you kiddies&rsquo; cheerios and raisins at the door<br>
    And you&rsquo;ll hear some scripture stories you ain&rsquo;t never heard before<br>
  <ol id="mormon-sunday-school">
    <li> God made Satan, Satan made sin<br>
      God made a place to put Satan in<br>
      Satan didn&rsquo;t like it so he said he wouldn&rsquo;t stay<br>
      He&rsquo;s been acting like the devil ever since that day.<br>
    <li> Adam was the first man that ever was invented<br>
      Lived all alone and never was contented<br>
      Made outta mud in days gone by<br>
      Hung on the fence in the sun to dry.<br>
    <li> Adam was the first man, Eve was his spouse<br>
      They got together and started keeping house<br>
      Everything was fine until the baby came<br>
      And then they started raising Cain.<br>
    <li> Joseph was a shepherd, too, he kept his father's goats, <br>
      his father used to dress him in the very loudest coats <br>
      his brothers got jelous and they threw him in a well <br>
      Joseph went to heaven and the others went to ---
    <li> Samson was a strong man of Superhero school<br>
      He slew several thousand with a fragment of a mule<br>
      Then along came Delilah who was all filled up with sin<br>
      She cut off all his hair and the coppers runned him in<br>
    <li>Young Prophet Nephi, brave and strong<br>
      According to the scriptures he could do no wrong<br>
      The way Arnold Freiburg pictured him<br>
      He must have gone to the Deseret Gym.<br>
    <li> The Jaredites split at the Tower of Babel<br>
      Their two great leaders were strong and able<br>
      Mahonri Moriancumer won great fame<br>
      But I can&rsquo;t remember his brother&rsquo;s name<br>
    <li> Brigham Young had twenty-seven wives<br>
      Twenty-seven forks and spoons and knives<br>
      Twenty-seven chairs and houses too<br>
      A nicer guy would have shared a few<br>
    <li> The earth was made in six days, finished on the seventh<br>
      According to the contract should&rsquo;ve been the eleventh<br>
      But the painters wouldn&rsquo;t paint and the workers wouldn&rsquo;t work<br>
      So the cheapest thing to do was fill it in with dirt.<br>
    <li> The Gadianton Robbers get all the thanks<br>
      For robbing all the Nephite banks<br>
      They robbed all the banks in the whole darn nation<br>
      Because they had the secret combination.<br>
    <li> Buy a book of Mormon without delay<br>
      Fifty cents is all you (used to) pay<br>
      Listen to me closely and I&rsquo;ll tell you what it&rsquo;ll do<br>
      If it reformed Egyptian it&rsquo;ll reform you.</p>

  <h2 id="frog-kissing"> Frog Kissing </h2>
  <p>You remember in the fairy tales, <br>
    When the wicked witch&rsquo;s spell<br>
    Changed the handsome prince to a toad.<br>
    Through the power of a potion<br>
    She handed him the notion<br>
    He was lower than the dirt in the road.<br>
    Although she left him green and warted<br>
    Her evil plan was thwarted<br>
    When he happened to chance by a young miss.<br>
    Who in spite of his complexion<br>
    Offered her affection<br>
    And changed the wicked curse with a kiss</p>
  <p><i>Chorus</i>:<br>
    If you&rsquo;ve never been frog kissing<br>
    Then you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve been missing<br>
    There&rsquo;s a world of opportunity<br>
    Under each and every log<br>
    If you&rsquo;ve never been a charm breaker<br>
    Then you&rsquo;ve never been a handsome prince maker<br>
    Just slow down, turn around, <br>
    Bend down and kiss you a frog</p>
  <p>Once upon a time ago when I was down and feeling low<br>
    Like a lowly frog in a pond<br>
    My life was just a joke and I was very nearly croakin&rsquo;<br>
    I was zapped by life&rsquo;s wicked wand<br>
    But in the depths of my depression, there came a true expression<br>
    Of love from a man so sweet<br>
    He gave me warm, fuzzy feelings, feelings that were healing,<br>
    And swept me off my little webbed feet.</p>
  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a happy-ever-after land, deep within the heart of man<br>
    Where prince and princesses abide.<br>
    But all we get are glimpses of the handsome prince and princess<br>
    &ldquo;Cause they&rsquo;re covered with a green, warty hide.<br>
    And though they&rsquo;re full of life&rsquo;s potential, <br>
    They&rsquo;re lacking one essential to enable them to shine like a star<br>
    And that&rsquo;s a handsome guy or missus to smother them with kisses,<br>
    And love them while they&rsquo;re just like the are.<br>
  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>
  <p>Just slow down, turn around, bend down, <br>
    And kiss you a frog!</p>
  <h2 id="clementine"> Clementine </h2>
  <p>In a cavern, in a canyon, <br>
    Excavating for a mine,<br>
    Dwelt a miner, forty-niner, <br>
    And his daughter Clementine.</p>
  <p><i>Chorus</i>:<br>
    Oh, my darling, oh, my darling, oh, my darling, Clementine, <br>
    You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine.</p>
  <p>Light she was, and like a feather(fairy),<br>
    And her shoes were number nine<br>
    Herring boxes without topses<br>
    Sandals were for Clementine</p>
  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>
  <p>Drove she ducklings to the water<br>
    Every morning just at nine,<br>
    Struck her foot against a splinter<br>
    Fell into the foaming brine</p>
  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>
  <p>Rosy lips above the water,<br>
    Blowing bubbles mighty fine,<br>
    But, alas, I was no swimmer,<br>
    So I lost my Clementine.</p>
  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>
  <p>In a churchyard near the canyon<br>
    Where the flowers grow and twine<br>
    There grow roses &lsquo;monst the posies<br>
    Fertilized by Clementine </p>
  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>
  <p>In my dreams she still doth haunt me<br>
    Robed in garments soacked with brine<br>
    Though in life I used to hug her<br>
    Now she&rsquo;s dead I draw the line</p>
  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>
  <p>Now ye Boy Scouts, heed the warning<br>
    To this tragic tale of mine<br>
    Artificial respiration<br>
    Would have saved my Clementine</p>
  <p><i>Repeat Chorus</i></p>
  <p>How I missed her! How I missed her!<br>
    How I missed my Clementine!<br>
    Till I kissed her little sister,<br>
    And forgot my Clementine.</p>

  <p>There once was a farmer who took a young miss<br>
    In back of the barn where he gave her a<br>
    Lecture on horses and chickens and eggs<br>
    And told her that she had such beautiful<br>
    Manners that suited a girl of her charms<br>
    A girl that he wanted to take in his<br>

    They could get married and raise lots of</p>
